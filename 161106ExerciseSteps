Summarize a genome assembly
We will be working with the Drosophila melanogaster genome. You can start at flybase.org. Go to the most current download genomes section and download the fasta of all chromosomes.

Print a summary report with the following information:

Total number of nucleotides
Total number of Ns
Total number of sequences
Repeat the above analysis, except split the data into sequences > 100kb and < 100kb

Print summary plots of the following:

Sequence length distribution
Sequence GC% distribution
Cumulative genome size sorted from largest to smallest sequences

ssh jbriner@hpc.oit.uci.edu

#module load allows you to use software uploaded by individual users. Peek at software jje has made available to the cluster:
module load jje/

#will find jje/jjeutils/0.1a useful. Has a lot of the software we've used in class. jje/kent/ has FAsize (fasta nucleotide counting). 

----------------------------------------------------------

#1) Prepare the files.

#1.1) download the fasta of all chromosomes with wget (-P prefix specifies the download destination). Pipe into gunzip
wget -r -A ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/current/fasta/dmel-all-chromosome-r6.13.fasta.gz -P "/home/jbriner/Desktop/(F16) Informatics/FinalExercises/Overview/dmel-all-chromosome-r6.13.fasta" | gunzip  *.fastq.gz


#1.2) Get a sense for what I'm dealing with
	cd "/home/jbriner/Dropbox/UCI/Classes/(F16) Informatics/FinalExercises/Overview" 
	head "dmel-all-chromosome-r6.13.fasta"

	#>2L type=golden_path_region; loc=2L:1..23513712; ID=2L; dbxref=GB:AE014134,GB:AE014134,REFSEQ:NT_033779; 		MD5=b6a98b7c676bdaa11ec9521ed15aff2b; length=23513712; release=r6.13; species=Dmel;
	
	#Data is arranged in columns


------------------------------------------------------------------------


#2) Summary time

	#Install package. Command line utilities for data analysis
	pip install data_hacks
	seq_length.py input_file.fasta |cut -f 2 | histogram.py --percentage --max=12972 --min=1001


#2.1) Print a summary report: total number of (nucelotides, Ns, sequences)

	#Exclude the header. Just count A,C,T,G.
	
	#How many nucleotides?
	count



#2.2) Print a summary report: total number of (nucelotides, Ns, sequences), but now for sequence data split into two parts: > 100kb and < 100kb

	#split data (check the baseball exercise)




#Running vwa of some reads against a reference genome. Interpret those reads to figure out what kind of mutation you're dealing with and where the mutation is. 
#Multiple types of genomes.
#Use different aspects of the reads to figure out what is going on.
#Investigate which of the flag fields indicates informative reads
#A couple of R plots will make it easier to figure out
