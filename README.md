Summarize a genome assembly
We will be working with the Drosophila melanogaster genome. You can start at flybase.org. Go to the most current download genomes section and download the fasta of all chromosomes.

Print a summary report with the following information:

Total number of nucleotides
Total number of Ns
Total number of sequences
Repeat the above analysis, except split the data into sequences > 100kb and < 100kb

Print summary plots of the following:

Sequence length distribution
Sequence GC% distribution
Cumulative genome size sorted from largest to smallest sequences
